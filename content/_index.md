I’m Andy Sukowski-Bang, a student from Germany interested in different fields
of mathematics and computer science, including machine learning, cryptography
and decentralized networking. Starting in October this year, I will pursue a
degree in mathematics at the [CAU in Kiel][1]. In my free time I go bouldering,
play electric guitar or develop software in C, Julia or Haskell (check out [my
résumé][2] and [my GitLab][3]).

## My Projects

I have uploaded most of my personal projects to [my GitLab][3] and mirrored
them to [my GitHub][4]. These are some of my favorite repositories. If you like
what you see and are absolutely dying to [send me some Monero (XMR)][5], feel
free.

## My Linux Setup

A few years ago, I completely wiped Windows from my SSD, replacing it with
Ubuntu. Over the years, I've distrohopped to Arch, Gentoo (took way too long to
compile programs) and finally to Void Linux. I've used Gnome, KDE, qtile, i3 and
now DWM from [suckless.org][6]. My workflow is primarily command-line based, so I
frequently use Neovim, ffmpeg, ImageMagick, GnuPG, [pass][7] and the *nix coreutils.
