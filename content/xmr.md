## What is Monero?

[Monero (XMR)][1] is a decentralized cryptocurrency, prioritizing privacy and
anonymity. In contrast to transparent blockchains such as Bitcoin, transaction
details like the sender, reciever and transaction amount are obfuscated using
[stealth addresses][2], [ring signatures][3] and [Ring CT][4].

Dynamic block sizes ensure low transaction fees, the [RandomX][5] proof-of-work
algorithm is resistant to ASICs, [Tail Emission][6] incentivizes mining,
while minimizing inflation (approaching constant 0.6 XMR block reward) and
the [P2Pool][7] sidechain enables decentralized pool mining without fees.

## Send me some XMR

I donâ€™t know why you would, but I'm definitely not complaining. Here is my
public Monero (XMR) address. You can find the PGP signed XMR address in RAW
format at [andy-sb.com/xmr.txt][8].
